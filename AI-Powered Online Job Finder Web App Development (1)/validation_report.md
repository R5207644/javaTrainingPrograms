2. **Controller Layer**:
   - Java Servlets for handling HTTP requests
   - RESTful API endpoints for frontend-backend communication

3. **Service Layer**:
   - Business logic for resume analysis, GitHub review, and job matching
   - AI algorithms for skill extraction and matching

4. **Data Access Layer**:
   - JDBC for MySQL database connectivity
   - DAO pattern for database operations

5. **AI & Analysis Layer**:
   - Resume parsing with Apache PDFBox
   - GitHub repository analysis
   - Job matching algorithms
   - Platform recommendation engine
