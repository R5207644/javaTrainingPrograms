# AI Job Finder Web App - System Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for an AI-powered job finder web application that analyzes user skills, improves resumes, reviews GitHub projects, and recommends job listings where the user would be a top applicant.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend Layer
- **Technology Stack**: AngularJS, HTML5, Bootstrap CSS, jQuery
- **Key Components**:
  - User Authentication Module
  - Resume Upload & Builder Interface
  - GitHub Repository Submission Form
  - Skill Assessment Dashboard
  - Job Recommendations Display
  - Responsive Design for Mobile/Desktop

### 2. Backend Layer
- **Technology Stack**: Java (JSP, Servlet), JDBC, Flask API
- **Key Components**:
  - RESTful API Endpoints
  - Authentication Service
  - PDF Processing Service
  - Database Access Layer
  - External API Integration Manager

### 3. AI & Analysis Layer
- **Components**:
  - Resume Parser (PDF extraction)
  - Skill Analyzer (identifies and categorizes skills)
  - Resume Improvement Engine (suggests enhancements)
  - GitHub Code Reviewer (analyzes repositories)
  - Project Analyzer (evaluates deployed projects)
  - Job Matching Algorithm (matches skills to job requirements)

### 4. Data Layer
- **Database Schema**:
  - Users (profile information)
  - Resumes (parsed content, versions)
  - Skills (categorized user skills)
  - GitHub Repositories (links, analysis results)
  - Projects (links, analysis results)
  - Job Listings (scraped/API-sourced listings)
  - Recommendations (personalized job matches)

### 5. External Integrations
- **AI Integration**:
  - Free GPT API for text analysis and generation
- **Job Platforms**:
  - LinkedIn API/Web Scraping
  - Naukri API/Web Scraping
  - Other job platform integrations
- **Code Analysis**:
  - GitHub API
  - Code quality assessment tools

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration/Login**:
   - User creates account or logs in
   - Profile information stored in database

2. **Resume Processing**:
   - User uploads PDF resume
   - PDF parser extracts text content
   - AI analyzes resume structure and content
   - Skills are extracted and categorized
   - Improvement suggestions generated

3. **GitHub/Project Analysis**:
   - User provides GitHub repository links
   - System fetches repository data via GitHub API
   - AI analyzes code quality, structure, and technologies
   - Project review results stored in database

4. **Job Matching**:
   - System fetches job listings from various platforms
   - AI matches user skills with job requirements
   - Jobs ranked by match percentage
   - Top matches presented to user

5. **Resume Improvement**:
   - AI generates suggestions for resume enhancement
   - User can implement suggestions in resume builder
   - Updated resume stored in database

## Security Considerations
- Secure user authentication with JWT
- Encrypted storage of sensitive user data
- Rate limiting for API requests
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Secure file upload handling for PDFs

## Scalability Considerations
- Modular architecture for easy component updates
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous processing for time-intensive operations
- Database indexing for efficient queries

## Integration Points

### AI Integration
```
User Resume/GitHub → PDF Parser → GPT API → Analysis Results → Database
```

### Job Platform Integration
```
Web Scraper/API → Job Listings → Matching Algorithm → Personalized Recommendations
```

### GitHub Integration
```
GitHub API → Repository Data → Code Analysis → Review Results
```

## Deployment Architecture
- Flask application deployed to production environment
- Database hosted on secure server
- Static assets served via CDN
- HTTPS encryption for all communications
